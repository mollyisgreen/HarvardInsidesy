	There’s a common misconception of Harvard professors being standoff-ish and inaccessible. This is not the case. Professors must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, as is true at any college. The vast majority of professors at Harvard try to make themselves very available for undergraduates, and they all have office hours. If anything, I’d say that Harvard undergraduates underutilize these office hours opportunities. Different departments have different reputations (most humanities-related concentrations have very involved professors, while large departments like Economics will have a larger proportion of less involved professors). That said, every department will have a healthy representation of interested and engaged professors.</br>

The vast majority of professors I’ve had have been very interested, engaged, and accessible.

You can use these ratings and comments to see what past students felt about professors. If you utilize this resource well, you should be able to completely avoid inaccessible or disinterested professors. There are MORE than enough engaged and fascinating
