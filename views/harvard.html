	Grade inflation</br>
  The average grade at Harvard is an A-/B+. Grade inflation definitely exists at Harvard, and it works well to students’ advantage in the graduate school/job application process. I actually think that grade inflation is a good thing because it encourages students to take intellectual and academic risks. There were numerous classes I took at Harvard that were rigorous and challenging and I could’ve been concerned about their affecting my GPA, but given grade inflation, I knew that I’d never get below a B- as long as I tried. This freed me to focus on learning, rather than constantly worrying about GPA.

  Professors</br>
  There’s a common misconception of Harvard professors being standoff-ish and inaccessible. This is not the case. Professors must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, as is true at any college. The vast majority of professors at Harvard try to make themselves very available for undergraduates, and they all have office hours conducted throughout the week. If anything, I’d say that Harvard undergraduates underutilize these office hours opportunities. Different departments have different reputations (most humanities-related concentrations have very involved professors, while large departments like Economics will have a larger proportion of less involved professors).
